# Harris Corner Detection and Match

This project implements Harris corner detection and feature matching techniques in computer vision. It includes:

- Harris corner detection implementation
- Feature matching using SSD and ratio methods
- Various test cases with different image transformations
- Visualization of keypoints and matches

## Project Structure

- `images/`: Contains original and transformed test images
- `keypoint/`: Stores detected keypoints for each image
- `matches/`: Contains feature matching results using different methods
- `output/`: Includes visualization outputs of the detection and matching process

## Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook `Cwk2_FeatureDetectionandMatching.ipynb` to execute the project.

## Results

The project demonstrates robust feature detection and matching across various image transformations including:
- Rotation
- Noise
- Blurring
- Brightness changes
- Pixelation
